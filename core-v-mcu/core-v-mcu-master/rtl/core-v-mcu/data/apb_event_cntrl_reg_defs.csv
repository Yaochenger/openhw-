Module,APB_EVENT_CNTRL,,,,,
,Memory address: SOC_EVENT_GEN_START_ADDR(`SOC_EVENT_START_ADDR),,,,,
,,,,,,
,This APB peripheral device collects all the events which presented,,,,,
,to the CPU as IRQ11 (Machine interrupt).,,,,,
,Each event is individually maskable by the appropriate bit in the,,,,,
,EVENT_MASKx register.,,,,,
,When an enabled event (unmasked) is received it is placed in a event FIFO,,,,,
,and the IRQ11 signal is presented to the CPU which can then read,,,,,
,the EVENT FIFO to determine which event cause the interrupt.,,,,,
,each event has a queue of depth four to collect events if the ,,,,,
,queue for any event overflows an error is logged into the appropriate,,,,,
,EVENT_ERR register  and IRQ31 is presented to the CPU. ,,,,,
